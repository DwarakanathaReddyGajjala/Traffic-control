# Two-Way Traffic Light Controller (Verilog HDL)

This implements a two-way traffic light controller using Verilog HDL. The controller manages traffic at a junction of a highway and a country road, ensuring safe and efficient traffic flow. The design uses a finite state machine (FSM) with 5 states to control the traffic lights.
